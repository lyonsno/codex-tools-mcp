# Codex Tools MCP Server

A minimal [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server implemented in Rust that exposes the `update_plan`, `ask_user`, and `apply_patch` tools used by the Codex GPT-5 model. It lets developers integrate these tools inside any MCP-aware client without running the Codex CLI.

## Build & Run
**Prerequisite:** install Rust toolchain 1.90.0 or newer (edition 2024 support) before building, e.g. `rustup toolchain install 1.90.0` and `rustup override set 1.90.0` in this directory.

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The binary communicates over stdio using JSON-RPC 2.0. Launch it from an MCP-compatible host (for example, the MCP Inspector or any tool runner that can spawn stdio-based servers). Run `./target/release/codex-tools-mcp --help` for command-line options (log level, version information).

During `initialize`, the server negotiates MCP protocol versions `2025-06-18` (newer clients) and `2025-03-26` (Zed compatibility). Unsupported versions return `INVALID_PARAMS`.

## Tool Schemas

- `update_plan`: matches the schema defined in `codex-rs/core/src/plan_tool.rs` (required `plan` array with `step` and `status`, optional `explanation`).
- `ask_user`: accepts a required `question` string with optional `choices` (string array) and `timeout_seconds` (positive integer). This build currently returns a structured unsupported response because no interactive popup backend is available.
- `apply_patch`: matches the JSON variant defined in `codex-rs/core/src/tool_apply_patch.rs` (required `input` string containing the full patch payload).

The `apply_patch` tool reuses the official Codex `codex-apply-patch` crate to parse and apply patches, so file changes are applied exactly as in the CLI. The server streams the CLI-equivalent summary back in the MCP response. `update_plan` returns the acknowledgement "Plan updated". `ask_user` currently responds with `isError: true` and structured error metadata (`kind: "unsupported"`) until an interactive backend is implemented.

## Agents SDK Demo

For local testing without exposing an HTTP endpoint, use the OpenAI Agents SDK with the stdio MCP server:

```bash
pip install openai-agents
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key python3 scripts/agents_demo.py
```

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or export it beforehand) so the Agents SDK can authenticate with OpenAI. This runs the codex MCP binary via stdio and asks it to write `hello world!` into `hello.txt` in the working directory.
